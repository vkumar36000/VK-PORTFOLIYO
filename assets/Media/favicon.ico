# Placeholder for favicon.ico
# In a real implementation, this would be a proper ICO file
# You can replace this with an actual favicon by:
# 1. Creating a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel icon
# 2. Converting it to .ico format
# 3. Replacing this file

# For now, this serves as a placeholder to prevent 404 errors
